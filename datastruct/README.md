Here's a summary of basic operations for various common data structures:

1. Array
Insertion: Add an element at a specific index.
Deletion: Remove an element from a specific index.
Traversal: Visit each element in the array.
Search: Find an element by its value (linear or binary search).
Update: Change the value at a specific index.
2. Linked List
Insertion: Add a node at the beginning, end, or a specific position.
Deletion: Remove a node from the beginning, end, or a specific position.
Traversal: Visit each node in the list.
Search: Find a node by its value.
Update: Change the value of a specific node.
3. Stack
Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove and return the top element.
Peek: Return the top element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
4. Queue
Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: Remove and return the front element.
Front/Peek: Return the front element without removing it.
IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
5. Hash Table
Insertion: Add a key-value pair.
Deletion: Remove a key-value pair by key.
Search: Retrieve a value by its key.
Update: Change the value associated with a specific key.
6. Binary Tree
Insertion: Add a node while maintaining tree properties.
Deletion: Remove a node and adjust the tree.
Traversal: Pre-order, in-order, post-order, and level-order.
Searching: Find a specific node or value.
Height Calculation: Determine the height of the tree.
7. Graph
Insertion: Add vertices and edges.
Deletion: Remove vertices or edges.
Traversal: Depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).
Searching: Find a path between two vertices.
Finding Minimum Spanning Tree: Using algorithms like Prim's or Kruskal's.
Summary
These operations form the basis for manipulating and interacting with the respective data structures. Mastering these operations is essential for efficient algorithm design and implementation.
