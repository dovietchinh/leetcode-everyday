# coding everyday

coding everyday is a good habit for programmer.

I consider letcode is my relax-place instead of playing video or wasting alot of time with social media.

# TECHNIQUES 

### 1. Two Pointer Technique
Used for problems involving sorted arrays or linked lists.
### 2. Runner (Tortoise and Hare) Pointer
Often used to detect cycles in linked lists.
### 3. Sliding Window
Useful for problems involving contiguous sequences, such as subarrays.
### 4. Binary Search
Efficient for searching in sorted data structures.
### 5. Depth-First Search (DFS)
Traverses graphs or trees in depth before breadth.
### 6. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Explores nodes layer by layer in graphs or trees.
### 7. Dynamic Programming
Breaks problems into smaller overlapping subproblems.
### 8. Greedy Algorithms
Makes the locally optimal choice at each step.
### 9. Backtracking
Explores all potential solutions and backtracks upon reaching dead ends.
### 10. Divide and Conquer
Divides the problem into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and combines results.
### 11. Caching / Memoization
Stores results of expensive function calls to avoid redundant calculations.
### 12. Bit Manipulation
Utilizes bit-level operations for optimization in specific scenarios.
### 13. Topological Sorting
Orders vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
### 14. Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
Efficiently handles dynamic connectivity queries.
### 15. Heaps and Priority Queues
Manages a collection of elements based on their priority.
