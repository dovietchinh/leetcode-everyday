# coding everyday

coding everyday is a good habit for programmer.

I consider letcode is my relax-place instead of playing video or wasting alot of time with social media.

## Letcode

## TimeComplexity

## Techniques

### 1. Two Pointer Technique

Used for problems involving sorted arrays or linked lists.

### 2. Runner (Tortoise and Hare) Pointer

Often used to detect cycles in linked lists.

### 3. Sliding Window

Useful for problems involving contiguous sequences, such as subarrays.

### 4. Binary Search

Efficient for searching in sorted data structures.

### 5. Depth-First Search (DFS)

Traverses graphs or trees in depth before breadth.

### 6. Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Explores nodes layer by layer in graphs or trees.

### 7. Dynamic Programming

Breaks problems into smaller overlapping subproblems.

### 8. Greedy Algorithms

Makes the locally optimal choice at each step.

### 9. Backtracking

Explores all potential solutions and backtracks upon reaching dead ends.

### 10. Divide and Conquer

Divides the problem into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and combines results.

### 11. Caching / Memoization

Stores results of expensive function calls to avoid redundant calculations.

### 12. Bit Manipulation

Utilizes bit-level operations for optimization in specific scenarios.

### 13. Topological Sorting

Orders vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

### 14. Union-Find (Disjoint Set)

Efficiently handles dynamic connectivity queries.

### 15. Heaps and Priority Queues

Manages a collection of elements based on their priority.
