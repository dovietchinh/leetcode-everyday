# Two-Pointer Technique

## Appoarch

Let take a look more detail about how two-pointer technique work.
We take two pointer. One representing for the first and one representing for the last element in sequence.
And then we add the value to kept at both the pointer.
If the sum is smaller than value, then we shift the left pointer to the right, or if the sum is greater them value , we shift the right pointer to the left. In order to get the closer to the the sum.
We keep moving the pointer until reach the sum as X
