Two pointer technique:
    detect cycle in a linked list
    fast and slow pointer
Partition problems
dutch flags problems: 
    sort array with all unique elements is [0,1,2]
    let mid pointer indices from 0 to len(array):
        if a[mid] ==0 : swap left left++
        a[mid] ==2: swap right , right--
        stop if mid > right

Sliding windown: 
    dynamic size windown: find smallest subarray have sum >= 8
